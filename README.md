# StuffDoer

This is an auto-clicker and text spammer app.

StuffDoer is an application built using the Pygame module for the graphical user interface (GUI), the PyAutoGUI module for controlling input, and the Keyboard module for listening to keypress events. It offers two primary functionalities: text writing and a clicker.





### Functionalities

1. **Text Writing:** Allows users to input text.

### Usage

To use the StuffDoer application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo and cd into it:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kan5661/StuffDoer.git && cd StuffDoer
2. **Install the requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run StuffDoer.py file:**
    ```bash
    sudo python StuffDoer.py
note: you need to run the file with admin privilege (sudo command) for it to access and control the keyboard and mouse

#### If you are a Windows user:
The .zip file contains an .exe, you can use it without having Python installed on your computer. Simply extract the content, and run the StuffDoer.exe, You will get a warning that the application is from an unknown source, and I can't do anything about that; you either click run anyways or don't run it if you don't trust me (as you should).
