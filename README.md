# StuffDoer

This is an auto-clicker and text spammer app.

StuffDoer is an application built using the Pygame module for the graphical user interface (GUI), PyAutoGUI module for controlling input, and the Keyboard module for listening to keypress events. It offers two primary functionalities: text writing and a clicker.

### Functionalities

1. **Text Writing:** Allows users to input text.
2. **Clicker:** Provides a functionality to automate clicking events.

#### If you are a windows user:
The .zip file contains an .exe, you can use it without having python installed on your computer. Simply extract the content, and run the StuffDoer.exe, You will get a warning that the application is from an unknown source, I can't do anything about that; you either click run anyways or don't run it if you don't trust me (as you should).
